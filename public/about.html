<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi, I'm a passionate student currently learning HTML as a part of my web development journey.  
  I enjoy exploring new technologies and building small creative projects to improve my skills.  
  My goal is to become a full-stack web developer and work on real-world applications.  
  Apart from coding, I also have an interest in science, football, and learning new things every day.
